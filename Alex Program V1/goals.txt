Alex Program V1

Step 1: program asks for input
Step 2: if the input matches one of the predetermined values,
the program will print a predefined response

All inputs case-insensitive

List of inputs and responses:
hi - Hello!
hello - same as hi
you suck - ur mum gay
bye - Goodbye!
echo - echo
marco - polo

Step 3: if the input is not recognized, the message
"I don't understand that" will be printed
Step 4: loop and continue accepting input until "exit" is typed

Useful Notes:
"\n" - escape character meaning newline
"def" - creates a function - Ex. "def process_message(message):"
creates a new function called process_message
